# ✈️ Airline Delays Prediction  
*Modelling flight delays to support travel insurance evaluation*

## 🌟 Overview  
This statistical modelling project explores the contributing factors behind U.S. airline delays, with the business objective of evaluating **travel insurance claims** based on delay likelihood.

## 🌟 Modelling Approach  
- Logistic regression model trained on cleaned and engineered flight data  
- Final tuned model achieves **92% accuracy**  
- Focused on **interpretable predictors** such as weather conditions, departure time, and carrier

## 🌟 Deliverables  
- `cleandata.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed data  
- `final.ipynb`: Logistic regression training and evaluation  
- `AirlineDelays_Report.pdf`: Full statistical report including charts, assumptions, and business insights

## 🌟 Tools Used  
- Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Statsmodels for regression diagnostics

## 🌟 Academic Context  
This project was developed for a **statistical modelling practicum** in the **MS in Applied Data Science** program at the **University of Chicago**.
